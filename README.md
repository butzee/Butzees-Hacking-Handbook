# Butzees Hacking Handbook [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

This handbook represents a collection of methologies, information, tools and scripts in the context of hacking. Eventually, it will be updated and expanded with the knowledge that I will gradually gather. This will be done by reading blogs, books and videos, but also by working on platforms like TryHackMe, PortSwigger, HackTheBox, and some more. The entire manual can be found on the following [Website](https://butzee.github.io/Butzees-Hacking-Handbook/). The site is provided via Github pages and was generated by Jekyll using the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll` and `Bundler`.

## Deploying the Handbook

There are several ways to access the state of the Handbook. Of course, the repo would need to be cloned first:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/butzee/Butzees-Hacking-Handbook.git
```

There are two different deployment options. Either by means of Docker:
```
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll build
```

or through Jekyll directly:

```
$ sudo bundle exec jekyll s
```
