Hello everybody. I am Butzee. The creator of this handbook.
This handbook represents a collection of methologies, information, tools and scripts in the context of hacking. Eventually, it will be updated and expanded with the knowledge that I will gradually gather. This will be done by reading blogs, books and videos, but also by working on platforms like TryHackMe, PortSwigger, HackTheBox, and some more. With each post, I will try to name the sources from which I gathered the information.
