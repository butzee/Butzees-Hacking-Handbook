## OWASP Top 10

</details>

This post contains informations regarding the Top 10 vulnerabilities from OWASP gathered from the corresponding TryHackMe Room. Nevertheless there are going to be more posts in the future containing more detailed information about the specifics of these vulnerabilities. That being said, have fun with the small insight to the Top 10 from OWASP.

## Severity 1 - Injection

Common injection examples:
- SQL-Injection
- Command Injection
    - active: returns response to user
    - blind: returns no response to user
Both injections change the intended and allowed way to execute code and therefore alow the execution of an arbitrary command.

Defense:
- Stripping dangerous characters from the input before processing
- Checking input for safe characters (White-Listing)

If server-side code like php makes an system call in a web application, a command injection occurred. Mostly it is used to create a reverse shell.

## Severity 2 - Broken Authentication

Flaws in authentication mechanisms:
- Brute force attacks (guessing username + password - multiple attemps)
- Use of weak credentials (easy to guess)
- Weak Session Cookies (Changing Values to other users)

Sanitization is also important. Sometimes you can re-registrate an existing user if you just add an empty space at the beginning of the name.

## Severity 3 - Sensitive Data Exposure

Flat-file databases are good, because they are easy to set up and pretty small for web applications. But on the other hand they can sometimes be downloaded and in that case the attacker hast access to all information.

Some simple sqlite3 commands:

|Command|Explanation|
|------|------|
|sqlite3 \<database-name\> | Open the database. |
| .tables | Show tables of database. |
| PRAGMA table_info(\<table-name\>); | List table-information.|

## Severity 4 - XML External Entity 

XE attacks:
- in-band XXE attack: attacker receives response to the XXE payload
- out-of-band XXE attacks: no response - output to some other file

XML:
- needs Root-Element
- is case-sensitive
- Elements can have attributes too
- DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes

XXE-Payload to read file from system:
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///path/to/file'>]>
<root>&read;</root>
```
