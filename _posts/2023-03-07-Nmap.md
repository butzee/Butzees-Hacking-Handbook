## List of important Nmap-Flags

The following are the descriptions from the manual in the respective Order mentioned in the TryHackMe Room - Further Nmap.

|Flag|Usage|
|---|---|
| -sU | UDP Scan|
| -sS | TCP SYN scan|
| -sT | TCP Connect scan|
| -sV | Probe open ports to determine service/version info|
| -sn | Ping Scan - disable port scan|
| -O | Enable OS Detection|
| -oN/-oG \<file\> | Output scan in normal and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename.|
| -oA \<basename\>| Output in the normal, XML, and grepable|
| -A| Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute|
| -T<0-5>| Set timing template (higher is faster)|
| -p \<port ranges\> | Only scan specified ports|
| -p- | Scan all ports|
|--script=\<Lua scripts\> | \<Lua scripts\> is a comma separated list of
           directories, script-files or script-categories|
| -Pn | Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery|


Lesser known port scan types (For firewall evasion):

|Flag|Usage|
|---|---|
| -sN | TCP Null Scans|
| -sF | TCP FIN Scans |
| -sX | TCP Xmas Scans|

## TCP Connect Scans -sT
Nmap tries to connect to port via a Three-Way-Handshake and the server responds with:
- if port is open: TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set
- if port is closed: TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set
- if port is behind firewall: nothing (packets dropped)

## Syn Scans -sS
This scan needs the sudo permission. It sends back an RST flag set after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server. Advantages: The scan is fasterOlder IDS are looking for a full Handshake and the scan is faster.

## UDP Scans -sU
An UDP-Port only responds with an ICMP - Port is unreachable, if the port is closed. Therefore you can't tell, if the port is open or if the send Packet has been dropped by the firewall.
